# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning 🌿

> 🔥 A complete end-to-end AI web app that detects **Tomato plant diseases** from leaf images using a trained deep learning model — built with 🧠 TensorFlow, Flask, and Streamlit.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project helps farmers, agriculturists, and researchers detect **common tomato plant diseases** from leaf images. Using computer vision and deep learning, we identify and classify leaf diseases into 10 possible categories.

> 🌍 Agriculture meets Artificial Intelligence 💡

---

## 🧩 What It Solves

- 🌾 Helps farmers detect crop diseases early
- 📸 Works by simply uploading an image of the leaf
- 🩺 Returns the type of disease and suggestions (via HTML pages)
- 🧠 Uses a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
- 🧪 No manual feature engineering — just pure deep learning magic

## 🌾 Diseases Covered

We trained our model to detect **10 tomato leaf conditions**, including:

1. 🍅 Tomato - Bacterial Spot  
2. 🍅 Tomato - Early Blight  
3. 🍅 Tomato - Healthy  
4. 🍅 Tomato - Late Blight  
5. 🍅 Tomato - Leaf Mold  
6. 🍅 Tomato - Septoria Leaf Spot  
7. 🍅 Tomato - Target Spot  
8. 🍅 Tomato - Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus  
9. 🍅 Tomato - Tomato Mosaic Virus  
10. 🍅 Tomato - Two-Spotted Spider Mite

## 🚀 How To Run Locally (Windows/Any OS)

Follow these 🔟 legendary steps:

### 1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/sushanthreddy009/plant-disease-detection.git 

cd plant-disease-detection


### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv


Activate:

- On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


- On Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate


### 3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


💡 This will install: Flask, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, etc.

### 4. Run the App

python leaf.py


### 5. Open in Browser

Go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000


### 6. Upload a Tomato Leaf Image

- Select a **clear photo** of a tomato leaf  
- Wait for it to process  
- Get **instant disease diagnosis** 🔍


## 🧠 Sample Output

Predicted Class → Tomato - Bacterial Spot Disease  
HTML Page → Tomato-Bacterial Spot.html  

The app renders a friendly web page for each disease with information and treatment suggestions.
